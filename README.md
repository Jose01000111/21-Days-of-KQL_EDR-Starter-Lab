> ## I am practicing this 21-day KQL Starter+ lab inside Josh Madakor’s Cyber Range 🖥️, working hands-on with EDR telemetry from an internet-exposed Windows VM. The focus is on building practical KQL hunting skills 🔍 using Microsoft Sentinel 🛡️ and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint 💻 to investigate activity, detect threats, and understand real-world security workflows in a controlled lab environment.
